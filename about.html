            <p class="about-paragraph">Florida’s history dates back thousands of years, with indigenous peoples such as the Timucua, Apalachee, and Calusa inhabiting the region long before European arrival. In 1513, Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León became the first known European to land in Florida, naming it “La Florida” due to its lush vegetation and in honor of Spain’s Easter celebration, Pascua Florida. Spain established settlements, including St. Augustine in 1565, the oldest continuously inhabited European-founded city in the U.S. Over the next two centuries, Florida changed hands between Spain and Britain before Spain ceded it to the United States in 1821. It became the 27th state in 1845 but soon seceded to join the Confederacy during the Civil War, rejoining the Union in 1868. <br>In the 20th century, Florida saw rapid development, particularly with the rise of tourism, real estate booms, and the construction of major infrastructure, including railroads and highways. The state became a key destination for retirees and tourists, with attractions such as Walt Disney World opening in 1971, transforming its economy. Florida also played a crucial role in space exploration, with the Kennedy Space Center serving as a launch site for NASA missions. Today, Florida is one of the most populous and diverse states in the U.S., known for its vibrant culture, booming economy, and significance in national politics.</p>
